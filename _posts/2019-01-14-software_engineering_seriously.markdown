As a child, I had many interests. Although gaming was one of them, pusuing tech career had never crossed my mind. I grew up surrounded by business moguls, and have spent the majority of my life deviating from that path; striving to become a physician. As tech became heavily intertwined with healthcare, I realized I could actually merge my interests together. I found the convergence of health, data science, and creative medium in software engineering; something I had never imagined myself doing. So here I am. I transitioned from data science into the creative exploration that software engineering allows. I am more inclined to the role of product management, but learning to speak the same language as the builders of the next tech platform that could improve lives seem like the next step to take. Currently trying my best to juggle priorities and burdensome demands in life to complete this bootcamp.
