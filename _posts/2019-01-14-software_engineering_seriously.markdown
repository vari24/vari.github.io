As a child, I had many interests. Although gaming was one of them, pusuing tech career had never crossed my mind. I grew up surrounded by business moguls, and have spent the majority of my life trying to deviate from that path; striving to become a physician. As tech became heavily intertwined with healthcare, I realized I could actually merge my interests together. I found the convergence of health, data science, and creative medium through software engineering; something I had never imagined myself doing. So here I am. I transitioned from digging through EHR for data, to the creative exploration that software engineering allows. I am more inclined to the role of product management, with particular interest in health tech, but I believe learning to speak the same language as the builders of the next tech platform to improve lives seem like the next step to take. Currently trying my best to juggle priorities and burdensome demands in life to complete this bootcamp.
